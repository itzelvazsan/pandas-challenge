# Analysis of City Schools Data

The purpose of this analysis is to help the school board to make strategic decisions regarding educational services. The analysis compares math and reading scores between educational centers in the city's school district in order to showcase trends in school performance.

## District Summary
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b36f514-add8-4e16-9e95-f7a222f776cd)

In total, the district have 15 schools that spend a total budget of $24,649,428.00. The schools have 39,170 students of 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade, whose average scores are 78.98 in Math and 81.87 in Reading.

There are more students that have passed Reading (85.80 %) in contrast with the percentage of students who passed Math (78.98 %). Only 65.17 % of the students passed both, Math and Reading.

## School Summary

This table shows that there are two types of schools: Charter and District. Bailey High School have 4976 students and it is the school with the maximum number of students. This school has a budget per student of $628.00, and the percentage of students passing: 1) math is 66.68%, 2) reading is 81.93%, and 3) passing both is 54.64%.

In contrast, Holden High School has 427 students, and it is the school with the minimum number of students. This school has a budget per student of $581.00, and the percentage of students passing: 1) math is 92.50%, 2) reading is 96.25%, and 3) passing both is 89.22%.

This could tell, in general, that small schools have better performance even if their budget per student is lower.

## Highest-Performing Schools and Bottom Performing Schools

In these two tables, we can observe that all of the highest-performing schools are Charter, in contrast with the borrom-performing schools which are District. 
We can also observe that District schools have a number of students between 2917 and 4761, and Charter schools have a number of students between 962 to 2283. This means that District schools are bigger in size, which can confirm the school summary conclusion: small schools have better performance even if their budget per student is lower.

## Math and Reading Scores by Grade

__Reading Scores__

In general, the tables show that Reading scores are better than Math scores. Data also shows, on the one hand, that reading scores are less skewed because all scores of 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th graders are in the range of 80-85. On the other hand, Math scores are more widely-spread because they are in the range of 77-85.

## Scores by Spending ranges (Per Student)

It can be observed that schools with lower budget per student have better perfomance in contrast with the ones that have higher spendings per student. However, this relationship does not mean causality, beacause some of the tables above showed that the effect could be also related to the size of the schools. In that sense, it is important to keep in mind the effect of both budget and size of schools on the performance of students. 

## Scores by School Size

As it was aforementioned, small schools have better average scores in both math and reading. However, when we observe percentages of passing students, the performance does better in medium schools.
The only certain conclusion that can be drawn from this table is that large schools have the worst performance in terms of scores and percentage of passing students.

## Scores by School Type

As it was analized in the Highest-Performing Schools and Bottom Performing Schools section,Charter Schools have better performance compared with District ones. However, it is important to mention again that District schools have more student population in contrast to Charter schools, which can be related to the level of performance, insted of only the type of school. 

## Summary and Conclusions

The main results are:
* Data shows that the 15 schools of the district have 39,170 students whose average math score is 78.98 and average reading score is 81.87. The percentage of students who passed math and reading is 65.17%.
* Data shows that the top 5 schools with the highest performance among their students are Charter Schools.
* The bottom performing schools belong to the District School Type.
* The scores by grade showed that, in general, students do better in reading than in math.
* The scores by school spending showed that schools that spend <$585 per student have better results. This can tell that a big amount of spending is not necessarily related to better grades.
* In Scores by Size, the only clear relationship is that large schools (2000-5000) have lower scores compared to medium and small schools.
* Scores by school type confirm the relationships observed in the top 5 highest performing schools and top 5 lowest performing schools. This showed that Charter Schools have better performance than District Schools.

In conclusion, there are three variables that must be considered to make decisions about school budgeting:
* Size of schools: Data showed that a high number of students is related to a bad performance. Small schools have better average scores in both Math and Reading.
* Budget per student: Even if the budget of schools is high, data showed that better performance comes from schools that have lower budget.
* Type of School: Charter schools do better in performance in comparison to District schools. This conclusion should be analyzed regarding size of school, performance can be related more with the number of students instead of the type of school.
