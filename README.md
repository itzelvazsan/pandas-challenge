## Project Description :page_facing_up:

This project is part of the Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp from TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey. In this assignment, the task was to create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data. In the exercises, it is supposed that our task is to provide help to the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. 

ðŸ¤“ This Project is the result of the learning lessons of Module 4: Data Analysis with Python from the Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp 2024. The main goal is to use the acquired habilities and knowledge in a real case. 

## Table of contents :point_right:

On the repository you'll find a folder named PyCitySchools, which contains:

| Item  |   File Type          |         File Name              |           Description                                                            |
| ----- | -------------------  | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |
|   1   | Jupyter Notebook     |  PyCitySchools_answer          |  Jupyter notebook with answers to the exercise                                   |
|   2   | Jupyter Notebook     |   PyCitySchools_starter        | Jupyter notebook with the starter code of the task                               |
|   3   |   Markdown file      |   Written Analysis             | The markdown compiles the results of the anlaysisis and the main conclusions     |

## How to Use the Project

* To solve the problem, you can use the starter code and the compare the answers with the Jupyter Notebook that contains the answers.
